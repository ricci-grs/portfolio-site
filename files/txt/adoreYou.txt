Ah, ah
Hey (hey)
Ha-ah, oh, mmm

Baby, baby, yeah
Are you listening?
Wondering where you've been all my life
I just started livin'
Ooh-oh, baby
Are you listening? Uh

When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you-oo-ou
I adore you-oo-ou

Baby, when ya hear me
When I'm crying out for you
I'm scared, oh, so scared
But when you're near me
I feel like I'm standing with an army of men
Armed with weapons (weapons), hey, oh

When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you-oo-ou
I adore you-oo-ou

I love lying next to you

I could do this for eternity
You and me
We're meant to be in holy matrimony
God knew exactly what he was doing
When He led me to you

When you say you love me
Know I love you more (I love you more)
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you-oo-ou
I adore you-oo-ou

When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you-oo-ou
I adore you-oo-ou
