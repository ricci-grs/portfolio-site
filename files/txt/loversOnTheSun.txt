Let's light it up, let's light it up
Until our hearts catch fire
Then show the world a burning light
That never shined so bright

We'll find a way; we'll find a way
To keep the cold night
From breaking in over the walls
Onto the wild side
The hunger's satisfied

We're burning up
We might as well be lovers on the sun

We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun

We'll never know, we'll never know
What stands behind the door
But I got a feeling
And it's a feeling that it's worth dying for

Just close your eyes and hold your breath
Because it feels right
We'll keep it moving 'til we make it to the other side
And let's enjoy the ride

We're burning up
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun

Let's light it up, let's light it up
Until our hearts catch fire
Then show the world a burning light
That never shined so bright
